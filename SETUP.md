Instructions for setting up, running, testing, and building the React portfolio application locally.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: `^24.12.0` (managed via `.nvmrc`)
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abhijeetjha0/abhijeetjha0.git
cd abhijeetjha0

# 2. Use recommended Node version (if using nvm)
nvm use

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start local development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/`.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Code Coverage

```bash
# Run unit test suite (automatically collects & prints coverage)
npm test

# Run tests matching a specific pattern (e.g. Experience component)
npm run test-filter -- Experience

# Run tests in watch mode for TDD development
npm run test-watch
```

---

## 📦 Production Build & Preview

```bash
# Compile TypeScript and build Vite production bundle
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

---

## 🔄 CI/CD & Deployment Pipeline

Automated via GitHub Actions ([`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)):

1. **Dependency Installation**: `npm ci`
2. **Mandatory Test Execution**: `npm test` runs the unit test suite and generates HTML coverage report in `coverage/lcov-report`. Build fails immediately if any test fails.
3. **Dynamic Badge Generation**: `node scripts/generate-coverage-badge.js` generates `badge.json` & `badge.svg`.
4. **Application Build**: `npm run build` compiles Vite bundle to `dist`.
5. **Deployment**: Deploys `dist` to GitHub Pages (`https://abhijeetjha0.github.io/abhijeetjha0/`).
